## Description

`poll-promise` is a Rust crate for polling the result of a concurrent (e.g. `async`) operation. This is in particular useful in games and immediate mode GUI:s, where one often wants to start a background operation and then ask "are we there yet?" on each subsequent frame until the operation completes.

Example:

``` rust
let promise = poll_promise::Promise::spawn_thread("slow_operation", something_slow);

// Then in the game loop or immediate mode GUI code:
if let Some(result) = promise.ready() {
    // Use/show result
} else {
    // Show a loading icon
}
```

If you enable the `tokio` feature you can use `poll-promise` with the [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) runtime.

### Caveat
The crate is primarily useful as a high-level building block in apps.

This crate provides convenience methods to spawn threads and tokio tasks, and methods that block on waiting for a result.
This is gererally a bad idea to do in a library, as decisions about execution environments and thread blocking should be left to the app.
So we do not recommend using this crate for libraries in its current state.
